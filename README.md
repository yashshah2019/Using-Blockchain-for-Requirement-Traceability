# Using-Blockchain-for-Requirement-Traceability

In this project, we propose and develop a blockchain-based architecture to enhance requirement traceability with the help of Solidity. The main motive for using Blockchain technology is its Immutability feature which provides complete security and protection to data inside the blocks.  Through this blockchain-based traceability system, we can store, record, and trace the requirements efficiently.

# Requirement Traceability Matrix

RTM is a mechanism that traces out the requirements with its corresponding test cases. The primary purpose of RTM is to validate that all requirements are checked via test cases such that no functionality is unchecked during Software testing. Requirement Traceability is classified into forward traceability, backward traceability and bidirectional traceability.

The fields which we have included in our matrix are as follows :-
1. Requirement ID
2. Requirement description
3. User stories
4. Test designer
5. Test Case ID
6. Status
7. Unit testing
8. System testing
9. Integration testing.

# Blockchain :-

Bitcoin is one of the most widely used applications of blockchain technology. It has been defined as distributed digital ledgers that keep records and transactions as encrypted time-stamped chains. Key terminologies of blockchain include distributed data storage, consensus mechanisms, time-stamp, encryption algorithms, etc. Blockchain technology is decentralized i.e. managed and executed by all nodes in the network; hence, there is no dominance of a single party. It greatly reduces the probability of information falsification, fraud, or corruption. All the above-mentioned features of the Blockchain can effectively protect data by ensuring consistency and reliability.

# Implementation

Mapping of requirements with artifacts is done efficiently using blockchain. We have implemented functions which can modify the status of test cases and different testing methods. We can also get all information corresponding to a particular requirement. We can directly get the status of test cases in constant time using mapping data structure.

RTM_using_Blockchain.sol file contains the code of above idea.
